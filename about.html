            <p>My first LMC event was absolutely fantastic!  The energy was incredible, a vibrant buzz of excitement that kept me energized the entire time.  
                What really stood out was the cheerdance compitetion.  Beyond the main sessions, I really enjoyed the
                volleyball during the lmc event.  I connected with several people who share my passion for the good, 
                and I even exchanged contact information with a few potential collaborators for future projects.  
                The conversations were stimulating and engaging, and I felt a genuine sense of community.
